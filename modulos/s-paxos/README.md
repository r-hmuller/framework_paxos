S-Paxos 1.0
==========

Description
-----------
S-Paxos is a Java implementation of Paxos with focus on high-throughput and scalability. 
S-Paxos is built on top of JPaxos (https://github.com/nfsantos/JPaxos), an efficient
multi-threaded implementation of Paxos, extending it with techniques that distribute
the load that is usually concentrated at the leader across all replicas. This allows
all replicas to contribute equally to the work of receiving and disseminating client
requests, thereby greatly alleviating the bottleneck at the leader. As a result, 
S-Paxos achieves in general much higher throughputs than a leader-centric implementation
of Paxos, and is also able to increase its performance with the number of replicas
(up to 7-11 replicas).

You are free to use S-Paxos as an experimental platform for research into
software-based replication or as a library for your commercial products,
provided that the LGPL3.0 licence is respected (see the LICENCE file).
Any publication describing work that uses S-Paxos in some way, should cite
